## Issues

I had issues with using Postman â€” initially the link didn't give me the API, it gave me a 404 error. I was able to manipulate the settings and it was okay. I also had problems selecting the description because of all the nesting, but the recorded video helped.

I'm still a little confused on how to tell if I'm using const and let properly.

## Resources

I just used the recorded lecture material. No other resources were necessary.
